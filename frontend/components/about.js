          I'm Kevin! A software engineer from Australia ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º. I very much enjoy learning to build things not just in tech but everything! It's awesome to see something come together from it's initial components. 
          <br/><br/>My primary focus is to develop technical solutions that makes life easier for not just the end-user but everyone involved which encompasses learning alot!
